# Project-model

This is a model directory for my working projects. 
This may be modified as I find more apropriate ways to organize myself

The idea is as follow:

	Project
	+-- Readme.md
	+-- project.ipynb
	+-- codes
	|   +-- readme.md
	+-- data
	|   +-- readme.md 
	+-- figures
	|  +-- readme.md
	+-- notebooks
	|  +-- readme.md
	+-- results
	|  +-- readme.md
	+-- writings
	|  +-- readme.md

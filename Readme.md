# Project-model

This is a model directory for my working projects.
This may be modified as I find more apropriate ways to organize myself

The idea is as follow:

```
Project
|-- Readme.md
|-- project.ipynb
|-- data
|   |-- readme.md
|-- docs
    |-- readme.md
|-- figures
|   |-- readme.md
|-- notebooks
|   |-- readme.md
|-- results
|   |-- readme.md
|-- scripts
|   |-- readme.md
```

* project.ipynb: ipython notebook to summarize all the important results, figures and steps
* data/		: folder for data used on the project
* docs/		: place to write an article ou another document
* figures/	: folder for figures
* notebooks/	: folder to store all ipython's notebooks created on the development of the research
* results/	: place to store results generated by the algorithms on the codes directory
* scripts/	: folder for codes created for the project

Each directory contains a readme.md file to list the content of each folder and quickly find a needed file
